The ordinary town, also known as vanilla townie, is part of the uninformed majority and has no special abilities. In order to win, the townsfolk must find out who the mafias are and lynch them so that no mafias are left.

There is a majority of town-aligned roles in each game and an ordinary town does not know the other town members, hence the uninformed majority.

If you can't see any roles in the special-role-private-channel folder in the Mathia server you are an ordinary town. If you have questions about the game, check firsthand this Mathia rulebook but if you can't find your answer there send a direct message to the game masters on discord.
