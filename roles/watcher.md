Every night, the Watcher can target a player to learn which players (excluding themselves) also target that player.

{% capture interactions %}
Watcher > X, Y > X;
Watcher returns "X was visited by Y";

Watcher > X, Y > X, Z > X, W > X;
Watcher returns "X was visited by Y \, Z and W";
Three different people visited player X so Watcher receives the names of three different players;
